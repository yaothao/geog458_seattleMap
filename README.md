# Seattle Airbnb and Nature Map Design

Check out the map design from [here](https://yaothao.github.io/geog458_seattleMap)

In this map design assignment, I focused on examing the Greanlake and U District Area. I have implemented four different tiles in my map. 
* The first tile is just an simple alternation of the base map. 
* The second tile include the Seattle Airbnb Listing dataset. The household locations are filtered based the number of review which is greater or equal to 200. 
* The third tile is the combination of the first two file. 
* The four tile is a thematic lay that illustrates the nature scene around the Greenlake and U District area. The parks and forest are highlighted with dark green color. The Neighboor font is bolded as I want to emphaize on the asscessibility to nature from each neighboor.

The available zoom level is from 1 to 14 for each tiles
